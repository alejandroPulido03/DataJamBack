# DataJam Web App

This project is a REST API developed during a hackathon, using the Django framework. The goal of the application is to enable companies to conduct internal surveys to identify and address issues related to exploitation and modern slavery in their supply chains and workplaces. The app provides a secure and anonymous platform for employees to report their experiences and concerns.

## Features
* Registration and Authentication: Companies can register and authenticate on the platform both anonymously and by adding their data.
* Survey Management: Administrators can create, edit and delete surveys, and can configure the score based on the questions.
* Anonymous Responses: Employees can respond to surveys anonymously to protect their identity.
* Sending Emails: Companies can send emails to their employees to fill out the survey, ensuring that responses are anonymous.
